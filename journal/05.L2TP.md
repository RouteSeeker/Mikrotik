# MikroTik Tunnel Setup â€“ L2TP with IPsec

Hi there! ðŸ˜Š

Continuing the tunnel series I started, this weekâ€™s focus is on **L2TP**. This protocol is a powerful option within MikroTik for building secure tunnels over the internet or between internal devices. In this lab, I walk through how to configure an L2TP tunnel **with IPsec** for added security.

---

## What is L2TP (and Why Use It with MikroTik)?

**L2TP**, or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, is a protocol used to encapsulate Layer 2 frames into IP tunnels. On its own, L2TP provides no encryption or confidentiality, which is why itâ€™s typically paired with **IPsec**, a protocol suite used to encrypt and authenticate the L2TP payload.

### Why L2TP with IPsec?

* L2TP/IPsec is supported by most operating systems out of the box
* Combines tunneling and strong encryption
* Ideal for remote access, branch office VPNs, or secure internal links

### How It Works (in brief):

1. IPsec sets up a secure tunnel using shared keys or certificates.
2. L2TP rides over that encrypted link, encapsulating PPP frames.

This combination allows MikroTik routers to securely transport traffic between networks, even over the public internet.

### Other Tunnel Options on MikroTik

* **PPPoE** â€“ Good for ISP-level access control
* **PPTP** â€“ Very fast but outdated and insecure
* **SSTP** â€“ Uses SSL over TCP (great for firewall/NAT traversal)
* **IPsec Only** â€“ Strong, but complex to set up alone

L2TP/IPsec strikes a great balance between **compatibility, security, and simplicity**, especially for remote access scenarios.

## Lab Overview

Weâ€™ll be using two MikroTik routers:

* **Server Router** â€“ Hosts the L2TP server with IPsec enabled
* **Client Router** â€“ Connects to the server using the credentials and IPsec pre-shared key

## Step 1: Creating an IP Pool

Before setting up the tunnel, we create an IP pool. Last week's PPPoE lab required setting a static IP for the client, but that's not scalable.

Navigate to **IP > Pool** and create:

* **Name:** `pool_l2tp`
* **Addresses:** `10.11.11.1-10.11.11.10`

This pool will dynamically assign IPs to incoming L2TP clients.

## Step 2: Creating the PPP Profile

Go to **PPP > Profiles** and create:

* **Name:** `L2TP`
* **Local Address:** `10.21.21.1`
* **Remote Address:** Use the pool `pool_l2tp`
* Enable **TCP MSS Adjustment**

### Why TCP MSS?

Enabling TCP MSS helps avoid packet fragmentation issues, particularly when tunneling across networks with varying MTUs.

## Step 3: Adding a Secret

Now go to **PPP > Secrets**:

* **Name:** `L2TP_Client`
* **Password:** `M1Kr@tik` (Use a stronger password in production)
* **Profile:** Select `L2TP`

### What is a PPP Secret?

Secrets in MikroTik act as **user credentials** for PPP-based tunnels like L2TP, PPPoE, and PPTP. They store the username/password, link the connection to a profile, and control how the tunnel behaves.

---

## Step 4: Enabling the L2TP Server

Go to **PPP > Interface > L2TP Server** and:

* Enable the server
* Select **Default Profile:** `L2TP`
* Enable **MSCHAPv2** authentication
* In **Use IPsec**, choose `required`
* Set a strong **IPsec Secret** (this is your pre-shared key for encryption)

### Why Use IPsec?

IPsec adds **encryption and authentication** to protect L2TP traffic from eavesdropping and tampering. Without IPsec, L2TP transmits data in clear text.

---

## Step 5: Configuring the Client

On the **Client Router**, go to **PPP > Interface > L2TP Client**.

In the **Dial Out Tab**:

* **Connect To:** Enter the public IP of the server router
* **Username/Password:** Use the credentials from Step 3
* Enable **Use IPsec** and provide the same **IPsec Secret** used on the server

Click **Apply**, and if all settings match, you should be connected!

## Step 6: Confirming IP Assignment

Under the **Status Tab** of the L2TP Client interface:

* Confirm that the **remote IP** (e.g., 10.11.11.2) has been assigned from the pool

---

## Step 7: Verifying the Connection on the Server

On the **Server Router**, go to **PPP > Active Connections**.

* You should see the L2TP\_Client listed as an active session

## Step 8: Testing the Tunnel

Back on the server, run a **ping test** to the clientâ€™s assigned IP address. You should receive a reply, confirming tunnel reachability.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

* Check that both routers have matching **IPsec secrets**, usernames, and passwords.
* Ensure that **UDP ports 500 and 4500** are allowed through any firewall between the routers.
* Confirm that the server has **L2TP Server enabled** and listening on the correct interface.
* If the client doesnâ€™t get an IP, check that the **IP pool** has available addresses.

---

## Best Practices

* Use strong, complex **secrets** and **IPsec keys**
* Always enable **MSS Clamping**
* Avoid using overlapping IP subnets on each side of the tunnel
* Regularly check logs under **Log > PPP** for authentication errors

## Final Thoughts

In this lab, we:
* Built an L2TP/IPsec tunnel from scratch on MikroTik
* Explored the purpose of profiles, secrets, and IP pools
* Secured the connection with IPsec and verified successful traffic flow
* Discussed real-world best practices and common issues

Until next time, never stop learning!
