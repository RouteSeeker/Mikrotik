# MikroTik Tunnel Setup â€“ PPPoE

Hi there! ðŸ˜Š

Itâ€™s been a while since I last did a MikroTik lab, but Iâ€™m back againâ€”this time with a new series on **tunnels** and the different options MikroTik offers. First up in this series: **PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet)**.

---

## What is PPPoE (and Why Use It)?

**PPPoE** is a protocol that encapsulates PPP frames inside Ethernet frames. Itâ€™s commonly used by ISPs to manage individual subscriber sessions, allowing features like authentication, IP address assignment, and session logging over a shared Ethernet infrastructure.

In MikroTik, PPPoE is frequently used to:

* Provide controlled access over shared Ethernet links
* Assign dynamic IPs or push routes to clients
* Apply rate limits or track usage per connection

While PPPoE is just one of many tunnel options on MikroTik, it shines in scenarios where **user-level authentication** and **session management** are needed.

### Other Tunnel Options Available in MikroTik

* **L2TP** â€“ Layer 2 tunneling, often combined with IPSec for secure site-to-site or remote access.
* **PPTP** â€“ An older VPN option; not recommended due to known security vulnerabilities.
* **SSTP** â€“ Uses SSL over TCP port 443. Useful for bypassing firewalls.
* **IPSec** â€“ Ideal for secure, encrypted site-to-site tunnels.
* **GRE** â€“ Simple and fast Layer 3 tunnel, often used in combination with IPsec.

This lab will focus on PPPoE, but stay tunedâ€”I'll be diving into the others in upcoming articles. ðŸ˜‰

## Lab Overview

For this lab, I used two MikroTik routers:

* **Server Router** â€“ Hosts the PPPoE server and assigns an IP to connecting clients.
* **Client Router** â€“ Connects to the server and establishes a PPPoE session.

---

## Step 1: Creating a PPP Profile

Navigate to **PPP > Profiles** and create a new profile.

### What is a PPP Profile?

A PPP profile defines the session parameters (like IP addressing and DNS) for each client connection. Think of it as a policy blueprint for how clients are handled once they connect.

---

## Step 2: Configure Addressing and MSS Adjustment

In the profile:

* **Name:** `PPPOE`
* **Local Address:** `172.168.2.1`
* **Remote Address:** `10.10.10.10`

Youâ€™ll notice the local and remote IPs are not in the same subnetâ€”and thatâ€™s okay. PPPoE doesnâ€™t require them to be, since it forms a **point-to-point Layer 2 connection** thatâ€™s logically independent of subnet boundaries.

I also enabled **TCP MSS Adjustment**.

### Why Enable TCP MSS?

Without MSS clamping, you may experience **fragmentation or dropped packets**, especially when tunneling over networks with smaller MTUs. Enabling this ensures smoother performance.

## Step 3: Creating a PPP Secret

Head to the **Secrets** tab.

* **Name:** `Client`
* **Password:** (choose a strong password for production)
* **Profile:** Select the `PPPOE` profile we created earlier.

### What is a PPP Secret?

This defines the **login credentials** used by the client to authenticate with the server. It can also control access, apply rate limits, or assign static IPs if needed.

---

## Step 4: Configuring the PPPoE Server

Go to the **PPPoE Servers** tab.

* **Service Name:** `Server1`
* **Interface:** `ether2` (connected to the client router)
* **Default Profile:** `PPPOE`
* Enable only **MSCHAP2** authentication.

### Why Only MSCHAP2?

Itâ€™s the most secure among the options:

* **PAP/CHAP:** Unencrypted or weakly encryptedâ€”easily intercepted.
* **MSCHAP1:** Obsolete and less secure than MSCHAP2.

Stick with **MSCHAP2** for real-world deployments unless compatibility demands otherwise.

---

## Step 5: Scanning for the Server (Client Router)

On the **Client Router**, go to **PPP > PPPoE Scan**, select the interface (ether2), and click **Start**.

You should see `Server1` appear in the list.

### Why is this Important?

This confirms **Layer 2 reachability** between the client and serverâ€”an essential step before attempting to establish a PPPoE session.

---

## Step 6: Creating a PPPoE Client Interface

On the client router, go to **PPP > Interface > PPPoE Client**.

---

## Step 7: Configuring Client Parameters

In the **General Tab:**

* Select the interface connected to the server (e.g., ether2)

In the **Dial Out Tab:**

* **Username/Password:** Use the credentials set in the serverâ€™s **Secrets**
* Enable **Use Peer DNS** â€“ This allows the client to use DNS provided by the server.
* Enable **Add Default Route** â€“ So traffic not destined for local networks is routed through the tunnel.

You should now see **Status: connected**â€”yay!

---

## Step 8: Confirming Active Connection (Server Side)

Back on the **Server Router**, navigate to **Active Connections** under PPP. Youâ€™ll see the client listed.

## Step 9: Connectivity Tests

From the **Client Router**, I ran ping tests to:

* Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`)
* The server routerâ€™s IP address

Everything worked perfectly.

## Final Thoughts

In this lab, we covered:

âœ… What PPPoE is and how it works in MikroTik

âœ… How to set up a server and client

âœ… Why MSS, MSCHAP2, and IP assignment matter

âœ… How PPPoE compares with other tunnel types


Until next timeâ€”never stop learning! ðŸš€
