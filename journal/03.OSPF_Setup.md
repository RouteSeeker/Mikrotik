# MikroTik OSPF Setup

Hi there! ðŸ˜Š

Building on last weekâ€™s **wireless setup**, this weekâ€™s focus is on **OSPF configuration**. The objective is to establish **OSPF adjacency** between three routers and ensure full network reachability. The network topology consists of the following links:

- **R1 to R2:** 192.168.2.0/24  
- **R2 to R3:** 192.168.23.0/24  

Each router also has a **loopback address**:
- **R1:** 1.1.1.1  
- **R2:** 1.1.1.2  
- **R3:** 1.1.1.3  

**Additional Networks Configured:**
- **R1:** 192.168.15.3/24, 10.0.1.1/24  
- **R2:** 192.168.100.0/24 (connected to the internet)  
- **R3:** 172.16.3.1/24, 10.5.0.1/24

## Step 1: Configuring IP Addresses

The first step is assigning **IP addresses** to each routerâ€™s interfaces, including **loopback interfaces**, which will be used later for routing decisions.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Router ID

### **Why is the Router ID Important?**
The **Router ID (RID)** uniquely identifies each OSPF router. OSPF requires an RID for adjacency formation, LSAs, and routing calculations. If a router ID is not manually assigned, MikroTik selects one based on the **highest active IP address** (preferably from a loopback interface). This can lead to inconsistencies if IP addresses change.

In MikroTik, there are two ways to set the Router ID:

1. **Automatically** by selecting the **Loopback** checkbox, which prioritizes loopback addresses.

2. **Manually** by specifying the **Router ID**.

![Manual Router ID](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.OSPF_Setup/05.Router_ID%20Manual.png)

**Best Practice:** Always manually configure a Router ID to ensure consistency, especially in multi-area OSPF deployments.

---

## Step 3: Configuring the OSPF Instance

In **Routing > OSPF**, I created an **OSPF instance**:
- Left the **Name** as default.
- Set the **Version** to **2** (since we are using IPv4).
- Selected the **Router ID** configured earlier.

---

## Step 4: Creating OSPF Areas

### **Why is Area 0 Important?**
OSPF is a **hierarchical protocol** where **Area 0 (Backbone Area)** serves as the central hub for inter-area communication. All other areas must connect to **Area 0** to ensure proper routing.

Under the **Areas Tab**:
- Created a new area **Backbone**.
- Set the **Area ID** as **0.0.0.0**.
- Assigned it to the previously created **OSPF instance**.

---

## Step 5: Adding Networks to OSPF

Next, I added **networks** to the OSPF process.

- Selected the **LAN** network (interface connected to R1).
- Assigned it to **Area 0**.
- Set the **Network Type** to **Broadcast**.

![Interface Template](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.OSPF_Setup/09.Interface_templates.png)

### **Understanding OSPF Network Types**
OSPF supports multiple network types, and selecting the correct one is crucial:
- **Broadcast:** Default for Ethernet; uses DR/BDR election.
- **Point-to-Point:** No DR/BDR, used for direct links.
- **NBMA:** Used for Frame Relay, ATM, etc.
- **Point-to-Multipoint:** Ideal for hub-and-spoke topologies.

**Best Practice:** Use **Point-to-Point** for direct router-to-router links to avoid unnecessary DR/BDR elections.

## Step 6: Configuring Passive Interfaces

### **What is a Passive Interface?**
A **passive interface** prevents OSPF from forming adjacencies on selected links while still advertising them. This improves security and reduces unnecessary OSPF traffic.

Under **Routing > OSPF > Instance Template**:
- Marked the **Loopback Interface** as **Passive**.

---

## Step 7: Configuring OSPF on R1 and R3

I repeated **Steps 2â€“6** on **R1 and R3**, ensuring they had:
- Correct **Router IDs**.
- Area 0 configuration.
- Interfaces added to the OSPF process.

---

## Step 8: Verifying OSPF Neighbors

After configuring OSPF, I checked the **Neighbors Tab** to confirm that adjacencies had formed between routers.

![Neighbor Adjacencies](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.OSPF_Setup/11.Neighbor_Adjacencies.png)

### **Troubleshooting OSPF Adjacency Issues**
If OSPF neighbors do not reach **Full State**, check:
- **MTU Mismatch:** Ensure interfaces use the same MTU.
- **Network Type Mismatch:** Verify interfaces use compatible network types.
- **Authentication Issues:** If authentication is enabled, verify keys match.
- **IP Reachability:** Ensure IP addresses are correctly assigned.
- **Router ID Conflicts:** No two routers should share the same Router ID.

**Best Practice:** Use `ip ospf neighbor` to check adjacency states and diagnose issues.

---

## Step 9: Checking the Routing Table

I checked the routing table to confirm that **OSPF routes** had been learned.

![Routing Table](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.OSPF_Setup/12.R1_Routing_Table.png)

### **Understanding the Routing Table Output**
MikroTik displays **OSPF-learned routes** with the `O` flag.

If routes are missing:
- Check that the correct interfaces are in the OSPF process.
- Verify that the routers are **forming full adjacencies**.
- Use `ip route print` to troubleshoot route propagation.

---

## Step 10: Advertising a Default Route

MikroTik allows default route advertisement under **Instances Tab**:
- Enabled **Originate Default** as **If Installed**.

![Default Route Originate](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.OSPF_Setup/13.Default_Route_Originate.png)

---

## Step 11: Confirming Default Route Propagation

I checked the **routing table on R1** to confirm the default route had been added.

---

## Step 12: Testing Connectivity

1. **Ping R3 from R1** to confirm internal reachability.

2. **Ping google.com** to ensure internet access.
