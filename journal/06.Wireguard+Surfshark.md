# MikroTik Tunnel Setup â€“ WireGuard with Surfshark VPN

Hi there! ðŸ˜Š

Continuing with the MikroTik tunnel series, todayâ€™s lab focuses on **WireGuard**, one of the newest and fastest VPN protocols available today. Even better, Iâ€™ll be combining it with **Surfshark**, a popular commercial VPN provider. This article will walk you through configuring MikroTik to use WireGuard with a Surfshark server â€” and explain everything you need to know along the way.

## Why Use WireGuard with Surfshark?

Commercial VPNs like Surfshark allow you to:

* **Bypass geo-blocking** (e.g., access content in specific countries)
* **Hide your real IP address**
* **Bypass censorship** in restrictive networks

Surfshark offers support for **WireGuard**, which is more modern and performant compared to legacy options like OpenVPN. If you want fast, lightweight, and secure VPN connectivity with simple configuration â€” WireGuard is a solid choice.

## What is WireGuard (Under the Hood)?

WireGuard is a **Layer 3 VPN protocol** that uses **UDP** and modern cryptography (e.g., Curve25519, ChaCha20). Hereâ€™s how it works:

* **Key Exchange:** Every peer has a public and private key pair.
* **Encryption:** It uses ChaCha20 for symmetric encryption and Poly1305 for message authentication.
* **Simplicity:** The entire codebase is under 5,000 lines, making it easier to audit and faster to run.

Compared to OpenVPN:

* WireGuard is **much faster** (less CPU usage, lower latency)
* Easier to configure (single interface, no SSL certificates)
* Integrated into the Linux kernel (faster performance)

## Lab Setup

For this setup, Iâ€™m using:

* One MikroTik router acting as the gateway
* An active **Surfshark account** with WireGuard configuration files

---

## Step 1: Importing the WireGuard Configuration

First, I logged into my Surfshark account and generated a WireGuard configuration for the **London server**.

Then in MikroTik:

* Navigate to **WireGuard > Interface**
* Change the **Name** to `WG-Surf`
* Set **Listen Port** to `51820`
* Paste in the **Private Key** provided by Surfshark

---

## Step 2: Assigning the WireGuard IP Address

I added the IP address provided in the config to the `WG-Surf` interface via **IP > Addresses**.

---

## Step 3: Adding the Peer (Surfshark)

In the **Peer** tab:

* **Public Key**: Provided in the config
* **Endpoint Address**: IP address of the Surfshark server
* **Endpoint Port**: Usually 51820
* **Allowed Address**: `0.0.0.0/0`

### Why use `0.0.0.0/0`?

This tells the router that **all traffic should be routed via the VPN**, though later in this lab, weâ€™ll use policy routing to scope it down to specific devices.

---

## Step 4: Creating a NAT Rule

Next, I created a NAT rule to masquerade traffic exiting the WG-Surf interface:

* Go to **IP > Firewall > NAT**
* **General Tab:** Set **Out Interface** to `WG-Surf`
* **Action Tab:** Select `Masquerade`

### Why this is necessary

Without masquerading, return traffic may be routed incorrectly or dropped. NAT ensures traffic appears to come from the WireGuard tunnel itself.

---

## Step 5: Creating a Routing Table

Under **IP > Routing > Tables**, I created a new routing table called `surf` and enabled the **FIB (Forwarding Information Base)** checkbox.

### Why create a new routing table?

This allows **policy-based routing**, where certain traffic (like a specific device) is routed through a different gateway than everything else.

---

## Step 6: Adding a Default Route via WireGuard

In **IP > Routes**:

* **Dst Address:** `0.0.0.0/0`
* **Gateway:** Set to `WG-Surf`
* **Routing Table:** `surf`

### Why this route?

It ensures that traffic assigned to the `surf` table is sent through the Surfshark tunnel by default.

## Step 7: Creating a Policy Routing Rule (My Laptop)

Under **Routing > Rules**, I added a rule for my laptop:

* **Src Address:** IP of my laptop
* **Dst Address:** `0.0.0.0/0`
* **Action:** `Lookup Only in Table` â†’ `surf`

### Why use "Lookup Only in Table"?

This forces only my laptopâ€™s traffic to use the VPN tunnel. It avoids conflicts by ensuring the lookup bypasses the main table.

---

## Step 8: Routing Local Traffic via Main Table

I created another rule:

* **Src Address:** `192.168.2.37/32`
* **Dst Address:** `192.168.2.0/24`
* **Action:** `Lookup Only in Main`

### Why this rule?

Without it, even local traffic might attempt to go through the VPN. This ensures internal LAN communication stays local.

---

## Step 9: Confirming the Tunnel is Working

I went to whatismyip.com before and after activating the tunnel:

* Before: My ISP-assigned IP

* After: An IP from **London**, as configured

## Best Practices for Surfshark + WireGuard

âœ… Always keep your **private key secret** â€” never share it publicly

âœ… Use **strong policy routing rules** to avoid traffic leaks

âœ… Verify VPN endpoints using **DNS over HTTPS** if possible

âœ… Regularly rotate keys and configuration from your Surfshark dashboard

âœ… Avoid using `0.0.0.0/0` in peer settings unless you need a full tunnel

## What We Learned

In this lab, we covered:

* How to configure WireGuard manually in MikroTik
  
* Why Surfshark makes a great partner for this setup
  
* How to apply policy-based routing using FIB and routing rules
  
* How to verify that the VPN is functioning as expected

Weâ€™ll be continuing with more **WireGuard-focused labs** in the next sessions. Stay curious, stay secure, and never stop learning!
