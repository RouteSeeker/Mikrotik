# Initial MikroTik Configuration

Hi there!

Having completed my CCNP ENCOR exam, I decided to focus my attention on other networking technologies that I have lying around. Since we live in a world where there is interconnectivity among different vendors, I decided to start a series on MikroTik.

{Why it is important to have knowledge of more than one networking vendor and benefits of MikroTik}

This series will involve bringing up a MikroTik router from the initial default configuration to complete connectivity with another router. I’ll cover static routing, IGP, BGP, VLANs, VPNs, firewall settings, and many more features that MikroTik has to offer. Today’s lab focuses on the initial configuration of the router.

### 1. Downloading Winbox

Winbox is MikroTik’s proprietary utility for configuring their devices. It provides a graphical interface that simplifies configuration tasks and is ideal for both quick setup and advanced management. You can download it from the official MikroTik website under the **Software** section. Winbox allows access through both MAC and IP addresses, making it particularly useful when the router lacks an initial IP configuration.

When connecting via MAC address, Winbox utilizes Layer 2 communication, bypassing the need for an IP address. This method is handy when configuring a brand-new device or recovering from network misconfiguration. For IP connections, ensure your PC is in the same subnet as the router or has direct IP reachability.

**Tip:** If you cannot connect via MAC, ensure your Ethernet interface is enabled, your firewall allows Winbox traffic, and try disabling any network filters or VPNs that might interfere.

### 2. Setting a Password

Upon logging in, a prompt asked me to change the password. With the old password being blank, I created a strong, unique password to secure the router. Setting a password immediately is crucial for preventing unauthorized access, especially on a production network.

Use a strong password with a mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using obvious passwords like 'admin123' or 'password'.

**Best Practice:** Avoid using default credentials and create unique usernames with restricted access where possible. Regularly update passwords and disable or remove default accounts when possible.

### 3. Setting the Correct Time and Date

Configuring the correct time and date is crucial for logging, certificate management, and ensuring scheduled tasks run as expected. Incorrect time settings can also lead to authentication issues in some network services. I navigated to **System > Clock** to set the date and time.

An accurate system clock is vital for time-sensitive operations, such as log accuracy, certificate validation, and task scheduling. Without the correct time, logs could be misleading, and automated tasks may execute at the wrong times.

**Tip:** For better accuracy, configure an NTP client under **System > SNTP Client** to synchronize the clock automatically. Point it to reliable NTP servers such as **pool.ntp.org** or a corporate NTP server if available.

### 4. Assigning an IP Address

I configured the router’s IP address under **IP > Addresses**, assigning 192.168.2.1/24 to interface ether2. Assigning an IP address allows easier management and the setup of additional network services.

When assigning static IP addresses, consider your IP addressing scheme to avoid conflicts and maintain an organized network. It’s also a good practice to document assigned addresses and update network diagrams accordingly.

I also changed my laptop’s IP address to be in the same subnet as the router to establish direct communication. Always use a compatible IP in the same subnet (e.g., 192.168.2.2/24) with the router’s IP as the default gateway.

**Common Pitfall:** Avoid assigning an IP address that conflicts with existing network devices. Use network scanning tools like **Advanced IP Scanner** or **Angry IP Scanner** to verify available IP addresses before assignment.

### 5. Reconnecting via IP Address

I was logged out of Winbox and reconnected using the new IP address along with the configured password. Using the IP address instead of the MAC address improves stability and access speed.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If you can't reconnect, verify your device is on the correct subnet, check your network cable, and ensure no firewall is blocking Winbox traffic on port **8291**.

### 6. Configuring the WAN Link

To enable internet access, I set up a DHCP client under **IP > DHCP Client**. I selected the interface ether1 and clicked OK. This allows the router to dynamically receive an IP address, gateway, and DNS servers from the upstream router.

**Tip:** Enable the **Add Default Route** option to ensure the router sets a default route automatically. This is essential for outbound internet traffic to be routed correctly.

---

### 7. Automatic Configuration via DHCP

The DHCP client automatically configured the Address list, Route list, and DNS servers, simplifying the setup process. I verified these configurations under **IP > Addresses**, **IP > Routes**, and **IP > DNS** respectively.

**Best Practice:** Regularly verify dynamically assigned configurations to avoid issues caused by DHCP lease expirations. For critical infrastructure, consider setting static IP addresses or DHCP reservations.
