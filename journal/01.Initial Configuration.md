### 1. Downloading Winbox

Winbox is MikroTik’s proprietary utility for configuring their devices. It provides a graphical interface that simplifies configuration tasks and is ideal for both quick setup and advanced management. You can download it from the official MikroTik website under the **Software** section. Winbox allows access through both MAC and IP addresses, making it particularly useful when the router lacks an initial IP configuration.

When connecting via MAC address, Winbox utilizes Layer 2 communication, bypassing the need for an IP address. This method is handy when configuring a brand-new device or recovering from network misconfiguration. For IP connections, ensure your PC is in the same subnet as the router or has direct IP reachability.

**Tip:** If you cannot connect via MAC, ensure your Ethernet interface is enabled, your firewall allows Winbox traffic, and try disabling any network filters or VPNs that might interfere.

---

### 2. Setting a Password

Upon logging in, a prompt asked me to change the password. With the old password being blank, I created a strong, unique password to secure the router. Setting a password immediately is crucial for preventing unauthorized access, especially on a production network.

Use a strong password with a mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using obvious passwords like 'admin123' or 'password'.

![Password](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/02.Password.png)

**Best Practice:** Avoid using default credentials and create unique usernames with restricted access where possible. Disable or remove default accounts when possible.

---

### 3. Setting the Correct Time and Date

Configuring the correct time and date is crucial for logging, certificate management, and ensuring scheduled tasks run as expected. Incorrect time settings can also lead to authentication issues in some network services. I navigated to **System > Clock** to set the date and time.

An accurate system clock is vital for time-sensitive operations, such as log accuracy, certificate validation, and task scheduling. Without the correct time, logs could be misleading, and automated tasks may execute at the wrong times.

![Setting Clock](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/03.Setting_clock.PNG)

**Tip:** For better accuracy, configure an NTP client under **System > SNTP Client** to synchronize the clock automatically. Point it to reliable NTP servers such as **pool.ntp.org** or a corporate NTP server if available.

---

### 4. Assigning an IP Address

I configured the router’s IP address under **IP > Addresses**, assigning 192.168.2.1/24 to interface ether2. Assigning an IP address allows easier management and the setup of additional network services.

When assigning static IP addresses, consider your IP addressing scheme to avoid conflicts and maintain an organized network. It’s also a good practice to document assigned addresses and update network diagrams accordingly.

![Setting IP Address](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/04.Setting_Router_IP_Address.png)

I also changed my laptop’s IP address to be in the same subnet as the router to establish direct communication. Always use a compatible IP in the same subnet (e.g., 192.168.2.2/24) with the router’s IP as the default gateway.

![Setting Own IP Address](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/05.Setting_Own_IP_Address.png)

---

### 5. Reconnecting via IP Address

I was logged out of Winbox and reconnected using the new IP address along with the configured password. Using the IP address instead of the MAC address improves stability and access speed.

![Logging in again](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/06.Logging%20in%20using%20Winbox.png)

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If you can't reconnect, verify your device is on the correct subnet, check your network cable, and ensure no firewall is blocking Winbox traffic on port **8291**.

---

### 6. Configuring the WAN Link

To enable internet access, I set up a DHCP client under **IP > DHCP Client**. I selected the interface ether1 and clicked OK. This allows the router to dynamically receive an IP address, gateway, and DNS servers from the upstream router.

![DHCP Client](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/08.Setting_up_DHCP_Client.png)

**Tip:** Enable the **Add Default Route** option to ensure the router sets a default route automatically. This is essential for outbound internet traffic to be routed correctly.

---

### 7. Automatic Configuration via DHCP

The DHCP client automatically configured the Address list, Route list, and DNS servers, simplifying the setup process. I verified these configurations under **IP > Addresses**, **IP > Routes**, and **IP > DNS** respectively.

![Client Configs](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/09.DHCP_Client_configs.png)

**Best Practice:** Regularly verify dynamically assigned configurations to avoid issues caused by DHCP lease expirations. For critical infrastructure, consider setting static IP addresses or DHCP reservations.

---

### 8. Testing Connectivity with Ping  
To verify the router's connectivity, I used the **Ping** tool under **Tools > Ping**. I started by pinging an external IP address, such as **8.8.8.8**, to ensure the router could reach the internet.  

**Why This Is Important:**  
- Confirms the router's WAN link is operational.  
- Helps diagnose potential routing or NAT issues.  

![Testing with Ping](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/10.Testing_Connectivity_With_Ping.PNG)

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If the ping fails, verify the interface status under **Interfaces** and check the **Routes** under **IP > Routes**.  

---

### 9. Testing DNS Resolution  
After confirming basic connectivity, I tested DNS resolution by pinging a domain name (e.g., **google.com**). Successful resolution indicates that the router’s DNS settings are correct.  

![Testing DNS](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/11.Testing_DNS.png) 

**Common Pitfall:** Ensure the **IP > DNS** settings include a valid DNS server and that the **Allow Remote Requests** option is enabled if you want internal devices to use the router as a DNS server.  

---

### 10. Laptop Connectivity Test  
To verify the router's internal network configuration, I attempted to ping the router from my laptop. While I could ping the router, I couldn’t access the internet, indicating a NAT or firewall configuration issue.  

![Laptop Connectivity Test](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/12.Testing_on_Laptop.png)

---

### 11. Configuring NAT (Network Address Translation)  
NAT allows devices on the internal network to access the internet using the router’s public IP address.  

- Navigate to **IP > Firewall > NAT**.  
- Click the **+** sign to add a new rule.  
- Set **Chain** to **srcnat**.  
- In the **Out Interface**, select the WAN interface (e.g., **ether1**).  
- Under the **Action** tab, select **masquerade**.  

![Setting up NAT](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/13.Setting_up_NAT.PNG) 


**Tip:** Use **masquerade** when dealing with dynamic WAN IPs. For static IPs, **src-nat** with a specified address is more efficient.  

---

### 12. Enabling Masquerade  
In the NAT rule’s **Action** tab, the **masquerade** action was configured to enable dynamic NAT. This automatically adjusts to changes in the WAN IP, ideal for DHCP WAN connections.  

![Setting up Masquerade](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/14.Setting_Up_Masquerade.png) 

---

### 13. Setting the Out Interface  
I configured the **Out Interface** to the WAN link under the NAT rule’s **General** tab. This step ensures that only traffic leaving through the WAN interface is subject to NAT.  

![Interface NAT](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/15.Interface_NAT.png)  

---

### 14. Testing Internet on Laptop  
After configuring NAT, I tested internet access on my laptop. Success here indicated that the router was routing traffic correctly and that NAT was working as expected.  

![Testing Ping](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/16.Testing_Ping.png)  

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If internet access still fails, check **IP > Routes** for a valid **0.0.0.0/0** route via the correct gateway. 

---

### 15. Changing the Router’s Name  
Renaming the router under **System > Identity** helps in managing devices, especially in larger networks where default names can lead to confusion.  

- Enter a descriptive name, such as **Mik-R1**.  
- Apply and verify the new name appears in Winbox and system logs.  

![Changing Hostname](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/17.Changing_Hostname.PNG)  

**Best Practice:** Use a naming convention that includes the router’s location or purpose (e.g., **HQ-Gateway-R1**).  

---

### 16. Confirming Router Name Change  
I verified the router’s name change in both the Winbox interface and through terminal commands (**/system identity print**). This step ensures changes are correctly applied and persistent after reboots.  

![Confirming Hostname](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/18.Confirming_Hostname.png)  

---

### 17. Assigning User Groups and Permissions  
I configured custom user groups to enforce the principle of least privilege.  

- Groups were set up with distinct permissions, such as **read-only** for monitoring and **full control** for administrators.  
- This approach minimizes security risks if an account is compromised.  

![Setting up groups](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/20.Setting_up_groups.png)  

---

### 18. Creating Users  
For better security and management, I created new users under **System > Users**.  

- Create a **Group** with specific permissions (e.g., **read**, **write**, **policy**).  
- Add a **User**, assign them to the group, and set a secure password.  

![Creating User](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/21.Creating_User.png) 

**Tip:** Avoid using the **admin** account for daily operations. Instead, create named accounts with only the required permissions.  

---

### 19. Setting Up the DHCP Server  
I configured a DHCP server under **IP > DHCP Server** to automate IP address assignment.  

- Defined an **Address Pool** (e.g., **192.168.2.100-192.168.2.200**).  
- Configured the **Gateway** and **DNS Servers**.  
- Set the **Lease Time** to **24 hours** to balance availability and address stability.  


**Troubleshooting Tip:** If devices fail to obtain an IP, ensure the DHCP server is enabled and that the interface is correctly assigned.  

---

### 20. DHCP Server Setup Wizard  
MikroTik’s DHCP setup wizard under **IP > DHCP Server** simplifies configuration:  

- Follow the step-by-step prompts to assign address spaces, gateways, DNS servers, and lease times.  
- Useful for quickly deploying DHCP on simple networks.  

![DHCP Setup](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/22.Setting_up_DHCP_1.png)  

---

### 21. Configuring DHCP Address Space  
I manually configured the DHCP address pool, avoiding static IP ranges to prevent conflicts. This ensures dynamic allocation only within a safe range.  

![Address Space](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/23.Setting_up_DHCP_2.png)  

---

### 22. Setting the Gateway  
Under **IP > DHCP Server > Networks**, I set the default gateway to **192.168.2.1**, allowing devices to route traffic through the router.  

![Gateway Address](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/24.Setting_up_DHCP_3.png)

---

### 23. Creating an IP Pool  
I created an **IP Pool** for dynamic address assignment. The pool helps manage available IPs and prevent conflicts.  

- Defined the range as **192.168.2.10-192.168.2.50**.  
- Monitored active leases under **IP > DHCP Server > Leases**.  

![IP Pool](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/25.Setting_up_DHCP_4.png) 

---

### 24. Adding DNS Servers  
I configured the DHCP server to provide DNS server addresses (**8.8.8.8**, **1.1.1.1**) to clients automatically.  

![DNS Server](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/26.Setting_up_DHCP_5.png)  

**Tip:** Always include a secondary DNS server to maintain resolution services if the primary fails.  

---

### 25. Setting the Lease Time  
I configured a **30 minute lease time**, balancing the need for address stability and efficient reuse of IPs.  

![Lease](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/27.Setting_up_DHCP_6.png)

![Confirming DHCP](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/28.Testing_DHCP.png) 

---

### 27. Making an IP Address Static  
MikroTik allows converting a dynamic DHCP lease into a **Static** one:  

- Navigate to **IP > DHCP Server > Leases**.  
- Select a lease, click **Make Static**, and assign a **Comment** for clarity.  

![Static Address](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/29.Making_DHCP_Address_Static.png)  

**Use Case:** Ideal for devices like printers or servers that require a consistent IP.  

---

### 28. Configuring a Static DNS Entry  
To simplify internal network access, I set up a static DNS entry under **IP > DNS > Static**:  

- Mapped **rtr.rseeker.com** to **192.168.2.1**.  
- This allows internal devices to use hostnames instead of IPs.  

![Static DNS](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Initial_Configuration/30.Static_Router.png)
