# MikroTik Wireless Setup

Hi there! ðŸ˜Š

Building on last weekâ€™s initial setup, this weekâ€™s goal is to configure wireless networking on my MikroTik router and establish a point-to-point wireless link using a MikroTik hAP Lite. However, I quickly realized that the HEX S router I initially set up lacks wireless capabilities. Fortunately, I had another MikroTik RB951Ui, which supports wireless, so I made it my main router. I repeated the initial setup steps from the last lab and assigned it an IP address of 192.168.2.2.

With that out of the way, letâ€™s dive into the lab!

### 1. Setting Up a Bridge Interface

MikroTik makes it easy to create a bridge interface, which allows multiple interfaces (both wired and wireless) to function as a single Layer 2 domain. This ensures seamless connectivity across all ports, meaning any device connecting via Wi-Fi or Ethernet will be on the same subnet.

Bridging is particularly useful in scenarios where you want all interfaces to share the same network without additional routing configurations. Without a bridge, wired and wireless clients may be placed on separate networks, requiring manual routing between them.

I named the bridge **LAN** on the **General Interface** tab.

### 2. Adding Interfaces to the Bridge

On the **Ports** tab, I added all the interfaces I wanted to be part of the bridge, including Ethernet ports and the wireless interface.

### 3. Fixing the IP Address Issue

When I moved my Ethernet port to the **LAN bridge**, the DHCP service stopped working because a DHCP server cannot run on a slave interface. To fix this, I had to move the static IP address from the original Ethernet port to the **LAN bridge**.

### 4. Troubleshooting DHCP Server Issues

After moving the IP address, I noticed the **DHCP Server** was still not functioning correctly. The interface needed to be changed from the old Ethernet interface to **LAN**.

### 5. Restoring the DHCP Service

I updated the **DHCP Server** settings to use the **LAN bridge** interface instead of the original one. This immediately restored DHCP functionality, allowing connected clients to receive IP addresses.

**Common Pitfall:** Always ensure that your DHCP server is running on the correct interface, especially when reconfiguring bridges. If DHCP stops working, check your **IP > Addresses** settings.

### 6. Configuring the Wireless Interface

Before configuring wireless, I enabled **Advanced Mode** in the **Wireless** settings for more configuration options.

In the **Wireless** tab:
- I changed the **Mode** to **AP Bridge** (Access Point Bridge) since the goal is to set up a point-to-point wireless network.
- I configured the **SSID** and **Radio Name** to make the network easily identifiable.
- I changed the **Frequency Mode** to **regulatory-domain** to comply with country-specific frequency regulations.
- I set the **Country** to **Kenya** to ensure proper frequency selection and power limits.
- Finally, I enabled the wireless interface.

#### **What is AP Bridge Mode?**
AP Bridge mode allows a MikroTik device to act as a wireless access point while also permitting multiple client connections. Unlike standard **AP mode**, AP Bridge supports **Layer 2 bridging**, meaning all connected devices can communicate as if they were on the same Ethernet switch.

### 7. Configuring the hAP Lite Router

For the **MikroTik hAP Lite**:
1. I powered it on and set it as a **DHCP Client** to automatically receive an IP address.
2. Under **Wireless > Wireless Tab**, I changed the **Mode** to **Station**.
3. I ensured the **Band, SSID, Frequency Mode, and Country** settings matched those of the main router.

#### **What is Station Mode?**
Station mode allows a MikroTik device to act as a wireless client that connects to an existing access point. This is useful for extending networks or creating **point-to-point** links.

### 8. Setting Up Wireless Security

By default, the wireless network is **open**, meaning anyone can connect. To secure it, I created a **Security Profile** under the **Security Profiles Tab**:

- Changed the **Name** to something recognizable.
- Changed the **Mode** from **Open** to **Dynamic Keys**.
- Since I wasnâ€™t using an external authentication server (like RADIUS or TACACS+), I enabled **WPA2-PSK** and set a **Pre-Shared Key**.
- I mirrored these settings on both routers to ensure compatibility.

![Wireless Security]([https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.Wireless_Setup/09.Point_to_Point_Wifi-Settings.png](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Mikrotik/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.Wireless_Setup/10.Security_Profile_on_both.png))

**Best Practice:** Always use WPA2-PSK (or WPA3 if supported) for security. Avoid WEP, as it is outdated and insecure.

### 9. Enabling the Security Profile

Back in the **Wireless Tab**, I applied the **Security Profile** to both routers to enforce encryption.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If clients fail to connect, ensure both routers have matching security settings (SSID, frequency, and encryption type).

### 10. Performing a Bandwidth Test

To verify performance, I conducted a **Bandwidth Test** under **Tools > Bandwidth Test** on the **hAP Lite router**:
- Set the **Target** as the AP Bridge routerâ€™s IP address.
- Changed the **Protocol** to **TCP**.
- Set the **Direction** to **Receive**.
- Entered the **Username and Password**.
- Ran the test and achieved **82.6 Mbps**.

#### **Optimizing Wireless Performance**
- **Channel Width:** Wider channels (e.g., **20/40 MHz**) provide higher throughput but are more susceptible to interference.
- **Wireless Protocols:** MikroTik offers three modes:
  - **802.11:** Standard Wi-Fi protocol.
  - **NV2:** MikroTikâ€™s proprietary TDMA-based protocol, reducing interference and increasing stability.
  - **NSTREME:** Optimized for long-distance links but requires careful tuning.
- **Antenna Alignment:** Proper alignment improves signal strength and reduces packet loss.

**Tip:** NV2 and NSTREME perform best in controlled environments without mixed vendor devices.

## Final Thoughts

This lab focused on setting up a wireless network with proper security and performance optimizations. In the next lab, we will dive into **routing protocols**, starting with **OSPF**, followed by **BGP**.
